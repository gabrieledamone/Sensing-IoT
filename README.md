**Author:** Gabriele D'Amone

**Overview:** This study aims to predict the Relative Indoor Humidity based on external environmental parameters. 

The **data_collection/** directory contains all scripts and data backups used during part 1 of the coursework.
The **data_analysis/** and **data_prediction_algorithm/** directory contains all scripts and data backups used during part 2 of the coursework.

## Dependencies

This subsystem runs using Matlab R2019b, Arduino IDE and Adafruit IO.

## Folders Description

This github repository has three main folders:

- **data_collection** (Code and files for data collection on Arduino)
- **data_analysis** (Code and files for data collection on Matlab)
- **data_prediction_algorithm** (Code and files for data prediction on Matlab)
